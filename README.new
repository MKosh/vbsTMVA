# VBS Analysis
## Notes
This is still very much a work in progress. It is an update for an existing analysis framework. Filenames are a bit screwy because it's at the in between phase where I'm finding all of the things that need to be updated.
The framework was already very automated, hopefully I can extend that so the user needs to do minimal updates for new runs.

## Things to update for new runs
One of the first steps is to run the "write_list_macro.sh"
    * Update variables
        * rootFiles - Point it to the folder where the files are held
        * subFolders - If the data is seperated (in this case by year)
        * Check all file locations used in the block that writes to the macroFile variables
            * locations
